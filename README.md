## 1. Online Hiring Scams

<details>
<summary>Scam in the name of Naukri.com</summary>
<br>
Description <br>
  
Yesterday, I received an email informing me that I had been selected for an internship I had applied for. The email requested me to send my resume, and without realizing it, I sent it. After that, I received a few more emails from different individuals stating that I had been selected. Unfortunately, I didn't notice those emails.

Today, I received a call from someone at Naukri, who mentioned that I hadn't been responding to companies and didn't have a job ID. They informed me that because I hadn't read the terms and policies of Naukri.com
, the company would take legal action against me and issue a challan of Rs. 48,000. I was confused because I had applied to several companies, but this situation seemed quite strange.

The caller spoke about the potential harm to my family's reputation and the possibility of a seven-year ban on my documents. Naturally, like anyone who hears about a ban on their achievements for no reason, I became worried.

The caller proposed a solution, suggesting that I pay Rs. 7,400 while staying on the call to cancel the challan. I decided to put the call on hold. <br>

<details>
  <summary>Olx Scam</summary>

One of the main places where different types of scammers look for potential victims is classified advertisements. On such a forum, con artists can be found as both buyers and sellers.

Once a victim is identified, the con artists manipulate them into divulging personal information.

These advertisements may be for used bikes, vehicles, or other items. These adverts, which frequently copy information from actual customers, may include images and other details. These days, instances involving Army personnel are the most common. In many instance, con artists pose as members of the army to defraud the victims of their money by earning their trust and demanding payment in advance. People are vulnerable to this fraud because they frequently do not doubt the honesty or authenticity of someone who claims to be an Army veteran. Fake documents are frequently produced by con artists as identification.
How is the Scam perpetrated?
Scammer posts an advertisement for a goods (such as a mobile phone, car, or bike) with a very cheap price (for instance, a mobile phone that costs Rs. 20K might be advertised for Rs. 12K) and enticing details like being used for just one week or never been used at all.<br>
OLX Scam Ad<br>
When a potential victim reads the advertisement, they think it's a great deal and get in touch with the con artist to continue the exchange of goods and money. After some haggling, the con artist accepts a lower sum (even if it is only a difference of Rs. 2 to 3K). The con artist further explains to the buyer why he is selling the item, citing things like how he can't use it while serving in the Army and other similar things. Along with the product Images (which are false), the scammer gives the buyer faked identity credentials relating to the army for verification. People do not hesitate to complete the transaction after only viewing the product's photos and without physically inspecting it.

Scam artists take advantage of this weakness. The scammer then asks a money transfer and divulges either his UPI ID or bank account information, which is typically with Paytm Payments Bank. Once the victim delivers the money to the specified accounts, the scammer may stop communicating with the victim or may continue to demand money under the guise of border entrance fees, toll fees, service fees, etc. until the victim realizes he is committing fraud. One scammer or a planned group of a few more people could be the perpetrator. The accounts they share could be the same or different each time. Scammers start to dominate and pressure the victim for additional money if they learn that the victim is paying the money right away.<br>
